# Bank Loan Worthiness Analysis


Analyzing borrowers’ risk of defaulting on a bank loan.

The goal of this project is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. Some considerations are if a customer’s marital status and number of children has an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank will consider findings when building a credit scoring of a potential customer. Credit scoring is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.
